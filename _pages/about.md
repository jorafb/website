Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Physics at McGill University](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca), working under the supervision of Professor [Andrew Cumming](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cumming/). Currently, my research focuses on double-diffusive convection. In particular, I perform hydrodynamic simulations of fluids with composition gradients in order to understand the transport of heavy elements in giant planets. I have also worked on statistical studies for inferring properties of [pulsar glitches](https://jorafb.github.io/website/glitches/).

In my free time, I used to take advantage of the many mountains around Santiago for daily training runs and participated in competitions that involve running tens of kilometers through the mountains with at least 2 km of elevation. You can see some photos [here](https://jorafb.github.io/website/portfolio/). Nowadays, I try to have as much fun as possible running on Mont-Royal Mountain in Montreal. You can follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/21142787) to see my run activities.

The best way to contact me is at rafael.fuentes@mail.mcgill.ca.
