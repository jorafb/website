Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Physics at McGill University](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca), working under the supervision of Professor [Andrew Cumming](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cumming/). Currently, my research focuses on double-diffusive convection. In particular, I perform hydrodynamic simulations of fluids with composition gradients in order to understand the transport of heavy elements in giant planets. I have also worked on statistical studies for inferring properties of pulsar glitches.
