## Toy Jupiter in a box: Penetration of a convection zone into a stable-stratified fluid ##

Giant planets like Jupiter, which undergo strong convection in their gaseous envelopes, might develop composition gradients from their formation history. During the early evolution of a giant planet, a convection zone propagates inwards as the planet cools down. How quickly does the convection zone move inward? What is the mixing mechanism behind this process? Using numerical simulations, we found that the rate at which the convective zone evolves depends on how quickly it cools down and how large is the initial composition gradient (a large composition gradient makes the evolution slower). Further, we found that turbulent motions near the boundary of the convective zone carry enough energy to lift and mix heavier fluid from below. This process is called "entrainment" and it seems to play an important role in the growth of the convective zone. We construct a simple model and provide a formula that captures the numerical results.
