Neutron stars are the densest objects in the Universe that can be observed directly. They are believed to be the remnants of fairly massive stars that have undergone supernova explosions. Their mean density is even higher than that of atomic nuclei, providing a unique environment to study the physics of extremely dense matter. Most of the neutron stars are found rotating very fast with extreme magnetic fields, which accelerate jets of particles along the magnetic poles producing very powerful beams of light. If the magnetic field axis is not aligned with the rotation axis, those jets of particles and light are swept around as the star rotates. When the beam crosses our line of sight, we observe a pulse (Fig. 1).

In other words, we see neutron stars turn on and off as the beam sweeps over Earth in each rotation period. This kind of neutron stars are known as pulsars. The rotation of these objects is extremely stable (several of them can rival the stability of atomic clocks) and shows a regular spin-down trend. However, pulsars exhibit sudden increases in their rotation frequency called "glitches", that occur on timescales as short as a minute (Fig. 2).

The physics behind glitches are not completely understood, but these phenomena are believed to be caused due to a rapid exchange of angular momentum between a superfluid of neutrons inside the star, and the rest of the components of the star. The observations of glitches are important since through them is possible to study indirectly the structural properties of neutron stars. Long term monitoring of radio pulsars has led to a large amount of observational data being accumulated: [there are now observations of hundreds of glitches from hundreds pulsars! ](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/pulsar/glitches/gTable.html)

How the glitch activity (spin-up rate due to glitches) depends on the properties of the pulsars (spin frequency, spin‐down rate, and various combinations of these, such as energy loss rate, magnetic field, and spin‐down age) ? Is the relation between glitch sizes and time intervals between them random or follow some regularities? Below you can find possible answers to those questions.
